# Introduction

See Gitbook [here](https://roland-5.gitbook.io/peatix-takehome-readme/).

See deployed app [here](https://rj13371.github.io/peatix\_takehome/).

The project is a simple single page web app which converts Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa. The app displays the output based on the formula. It also displays a thermometer animation depending on the value of the result.
